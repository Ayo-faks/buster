## Directory Structure
Each feature component should be organized in its own directory using the following structure:

```
features/
  └── ComponentName/
      ├── ComponentName.tsx        # Main component implementation
      ├── ComponentName.test.tsx   # Tests for the component (if asked for it)
      ├── ComponentName.stories.tsx # Storybook stories for the component
