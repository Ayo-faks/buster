# Cursor Rules

## Directory Structure

This directory contains all the namespaces, each organized into separate folders. Every namespace follows this structure:

```
/namespaces/
  ├── namespace1/
  │   ├── index.ts
  │   ├── interfaces.ts
  ├── namespace2/
  │   ├── index.ts
  │   ├── interfaces.ts
  ...
```

### File Descriptions

#### `index.ts`
- This file serves as the entry point for the namespace, exporting all relevant types and utilities.

#### `interfaces.ts`
- This file defines the TypeScript interfaces for the namespace. This is mostly just the response interfaces. The request interfaces should be defined as a param on the request itself.
- All interfaces must be documented using **TSDoc** to ensure clarity and maintainability.

Example:
```ts
/**
 * Represents a user profile in the system.
 */
export interface UserProfile {
  /** The unique identifier for the user */
  id: string;
  
  /** The user's display name */
  name: string;
}
```

## Usage

These namespace types will be imported into the following locations:
- `/src/api/buster_rest/*`
- `/src/api/buster_socket/*`
- `/src/api/buster_socket_query/*`

Ensure that all types are properly imported and used to maintain consistency across the codebase.
