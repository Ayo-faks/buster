- All new stories title with "UI/directory/{componentName}" unless specified otherwise.
- Instead of console log for click events, you should do native storybook actions
- If a new story is made in the controller directory, I would like it title "Controllers/{controller name or parent controller name}/{componentName}"
- If a new story is found in the features directory, I would like it titled "Features/{featureName or parent feature name}/{componentName}"
- onClick events (or similar) should be mocked with fn() from the storybook test package
