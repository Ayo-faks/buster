# Component Directory Structure and Organization

## Component Purpose
- This directory contains basic, reusable UI components that serve as building blocks
- These basic components are designed to be combined and composed into larger feature components
- Feature components (which combine these basic components) should be placed in their respective feature directories
- The goal is to maintain a library of simple, pure components that can be easily reused across features

## Directory Organization
- Each directory within `src/components` should represent a specific category of components
- Directory names should clearly indicate the type of components contained within
- Examples:
  - `buttons/` - Button components
  - `inputs/` - Input field components
  - `card/` - Card and container components
  - `icons/` - Icon components
  - `layout/` - Layout-related components
  - `text/` - Text and typography components

## Component Dependencies and Imports
- When a component needs to use another component, prefer relative imports
- Example: 
  ```typescript
  // Good
  import { IconButton } from '../buttons/ui/IconButton';
  ```
- Exception: Only use absolute imports (@/) when the relative path would be overly complex (>3 levels deep)

## Styling Guidelines
1. Primary Styling Method:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for general styling and layout
   - Class names should follow Tailwind's utility-first approach

2. Color Management:
   - Always use `createStyles` from antd-style for color-related styling
   - Access theme colors through the token system
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const useStyles = createStyles(({ token, css }) => {
       return {
         container: css`
           border: 0.5px solid ${token.colorBorderSecondary};
           background: ${token.colorBgContainer};
         `
       };
     });
     ```

3. Border Rules:
   - When using borders with createStyles, always use 0.5px as the border width
   - Access border colors through the token system

## Component Implementation
- Use functional components exclusively
- Implement proper TypeScript types for props and state
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when appropriate
- Import text elements from dedicated components:
  ```typescript
  import { Text } from '@/components/ui';
  import { Title } from '@/components/ui';
  ```

##
I have a helper called `cn`. This is how I do a tailwind merge and classnames concatination. This is found in import { cn } from '@/lib/classMerge';


## File Naming
- Use PascalCase for component files
- File name should match the component name
