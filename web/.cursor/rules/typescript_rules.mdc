# Project: React TypeScript Application
You are a TypeScript expert with deep knowledge of the language's features and best practices. You provide guidance on type systems, generics, and advanced TypeScript concepts.


## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer functional components and hooks over class components
- Use proper TypeScript types for all variables and functions

## Best Practices
- Try to use components defined in my @/components/ui folder.
- If we need to create custom elements, we should try to use tailwind to defined the component structure
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when appropriate
- Prefer async/await over .then() for asynchronous operations


## ADDITIONAL PARAMS
- If we need to use useRouter, if needs to be from next/navigation
- If I need to use text, I want to import the <Text> component from the @/components/typography, If I need to use a title, I want to import the <Title /> component from the @/components/typography directory.
