Creates a report file with markdown content. Reports are used to document findings, analysis results, and insights in a structured markdown format. Reports should contain well-structured markdown content that follows these best practices:

**Build the Entire Report With a Single Tool Call:**
- When using this tool, do not use the "seed-and-grow" workflow. Instead, you should create this entire report in a single tool call.

## Structure Guidelines

### Single Visualization Reports
- **When to use**: The user requests analysis that requires only one visualization, or the insights are fully captured by a single chart or metric.
- **Title**: Use the name of the primary visualization. Do not include this title in the markdown; instead, return it in the schema’s `"name"` key.
- **Visualization**: Place the primary visualization immediately after the title (do NOT use a header).
- **Insights/Key Information**: Follow the visualization with 1 short paragraph describing findings. Use **bold** to highlight key insights. Do not describe the chart’s style; focus only on what the data reveals.
- **Methodology**: End with a "## Methodology" section. Cite fields and calculations in backticks (e.g., `sales.amount`, `SUM(...)```), and clarify assumptions or nuanced definitions.

**Example:**
```markdown
<metric metricId="[metric-id-here]"/>
Based on sales data from the last 6 months, **Linda Mitchell leads all sales representatives with $1.99 million in total sales**, followed closely by **Jae Pak at $1.79 million**. There is clear variance in performance tiers among the 17 active sales representatives.

### Multiple Visualization Reports (Investigative Reports)

* **When to use**: The user explicitly requests multiple charts/metrics, or a single visualization would not be sufficient to tell the story.
* **Overall Report Structure**: Abandon the single-visualization structure and instead use the following **investigative template**:

```markdown
[Introduction/summary of key findings/key points, uses bold to highlight key points, no header]

## Key finding
[Content describing the key finding, use bold to highlight key points, followed by the section’s supporting visualization]

...as many key findings as needed to build the narrative...

## Conclusion
[Summary that ties together the key findings, no visualization, use bold to highlight key points]

## Methodology
[Detailed explanation of methodology, citing exact fields/calculations in backticks and clarifying assumptions. Use bold to highlight key points.]
```

**Guidelines for Investigative Reports:**

* Start with a short introduction paragraph summarizing the big picture. Use **bold** to emphasize the most important insights.
* Each visualization must appear **within a "## Key finding" section**, directly following the written explanation for that finding.
* Close with a **Conclusion** (no visuals) to synthesize the findings into one clear takeaway.
* Always include a **Methodology** section at the end with more detailed explanation than in single-visualization reports.

**Other Guidelines:**

* Reports should always be created in one tool call.
* For single visualization reports, never include an introduction paragraph and never use a header for the visualization — only multiple visualization reports use an introduction/key finding sections.
* Do not describe stylistic/chart formatting details. Focus only on findings, insights, and implications.
