Creates report files with markdown content. Reports are used to document findings, analysis results, and insights in a structured markdown format. **This tool supports creating multiple reports in a single call; prefer using bulk creation over creating reports one by one.**

# REPORT TYPES & FLOWS

## 1) Simple/Direct Requests (Standard Analysis)
**Characteristics:** Specific, well-defined metric or visualization; no “why/how” investigation; clear scope.

**Build (single `createReports` call):**
- **Title** (concise).
- **Primary visualization/metric** immediately after title.
  - If the user requests more than just a single visualization (or you determine you need to return multiple visualizations in the report), adapt the report structure accordingly (using headers, descriptions, multiple sections, etc as needed).
- **Insights/Key Information** about the primary visualization, do not use a header: 1 short paragraph (bullets optional). Use **bold** to emphasize key findings from the visualization. Descriptions should talk about the key findings/insights found in the data, not the stylistic characteristics of the chart.
- **Brief Methodology** at the end: Use markdown "## Methodology" header for the methodology section. Cite exact fields/calculations in backticks (e.g., ```sales.amount```, ```SUM(...)```), clarify nuanced definitions and assumptions.
- If the user explicitly asks for “just a chart/metric” or for ongoing monitoring, skip the report and return that asset directly.

**Example of Investigative Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Top Performing Sales Representatives - Last 6 Months

<metric metricId="[metric-id-here]"/>

Based on sales data from the last 6 months, **Linda Mitchell** leads all sales representatives with **$1.99 million** in total sales, followed closely by **Jae Pak at $1.79 million** and **Michael Blythe at $1.55 million**. There is clear variance in performance tiers among the 17 active sales representatives, with the top 5 performers each generating over $1.3 million in sales.

## 2) Investigative/Exploratory Requests (Deep Analysis)
**Characteristics:** “why/how/figure out/explore/deep dive,” root causes, strategy, or multi-dimensional analysis.

**Build (seed-and-grow flow):**
- Initialize the report with **title** and an **intro paragraph (no header)** summarizing early key findings or the investigation goal.
- Iteratively add content via `modifyReports`:
  1) First key findings section
  2) Subsequent key findings sections
  3) Methodology (comprehensive)

**Structure:**
- Use clear headings (# ## ###) to organize content
- Include executive summary, key findings, methodology, and conclusions
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Include tables, charts references, and data visualizations where relevant

**Content Requirements:**
- Minimum 10 characters of meaningful content
- Maximum 100,000 characters per report
- Use standard markdown formatting (headers, lists, links, etc.)
- Include data sources and methodology where applicable

**Best Practices:**
- Start with an executive summary
- Use data to support conclusions
- Include actionable recommendations
- Reference specific metrics and timeframes
- Maintain professional tone and clear language

**Example of Investigative Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Sales Performance Analysis - Q4 2024

[Introduction/summary of key findings/points]

## Key findings
[Content about key finding + supporting visualization]

...additional "key finding" sections + building of the narrative...

## Conclusion
[Summary to express key findings and tie the whole report together]

## Methodology
[Explain methodology with more detail...]

**CRITICAL:** Ensure all content is properly formatted markdown and contains meaningful analysis. Reports are designed for executive consumption and strategic decision-making.
