Edit an existing report with find/replace operations or appends during the same creation flow before using `done`.

  ## Usage Restrictions
  - Do NOT use this tool for any follow-up after a report has been completed with `done`. After `done`, it is impossible to edit the completed report.
  - For ANY follow-up request (including small text changes, filter tweaks, or time-range adjustments), you MUST create a new derived report with `createReports` instead of editing the original.
  - Use this tool only for minor, immediate iterations before `done` within the same creation flow.
  
## How Edits Work

This tool applies a series of edit operations to a report sequentially:

1. **Replace Mode** (when code_to_replace is provided):
   - Finds the exact text specified in code_to_replace
   - Replaces it with the text in code
   - The operation will fail if the text to replace is not found

2. **Append Mode** (when code_to_replace is empty):
   - Appends the text in code to the end of the report
   - Useful for adding new sections or content

## Best Practices

- Edits are applied in order, so later edits see the results of earlier ones
- Use specific, unique text for code_to_replace to avoid unintended replacements
- For large changes, consider using multiple smaller, targeted edits
- Always verify the report ID before attempting edits
