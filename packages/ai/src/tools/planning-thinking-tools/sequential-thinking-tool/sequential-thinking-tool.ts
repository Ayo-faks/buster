    description: `A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

**When to use this tool:**
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

**Key features:**
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

**You should:**
1. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
2. Express uncertainty when present
3. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
4. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
5. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
6. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
7. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
8. Only set nextThoughtNeeded to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached`,
