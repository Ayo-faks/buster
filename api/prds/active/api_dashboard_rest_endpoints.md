# Dashboard REST Endpoints

## Problem Statement

The dashboard functionality in our application currently has limited REST API support. While we have endpoints for listing and retrieving dashboards, we lack the ability to create, update, and delete dashboards through the REST API. This limitation prevents users from programmatically managing their dashboards, which is a critical feature for automation and integration with other systems.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a complete set of REST endpoints for dashboard management:

1. **Create Dashboard** - POST /dashboards
2. **Update Dashboard** - PUT /dashboards/:id
3. **Delete Dashboard** - DELETE /dashboards/:id

These endpoints will complement the existing GET endpoints and provide full CRUD functionality for dashboards.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will be divided into three phases, which can be worked on concurrently:

### Phase 1: Create Dashboard Endpoint
- Implement POST /dashboards endpoint
- Create handler for dashboard creation
- Add tests for the endpoint

### Phase 2: Update Dashboard Endpoint
- Implement PUT /dashboards/:id endpoint
- Create handler for dashboard updates
- Add tests for the endpoint

### Phase 3: Delete Dashboard Endpoint
- Implement DELETE /dashboards/:id endpoint
- Create handler for dashboard deletion
- Add tests for the endpoint

## Dependencies

- Existing dashboard models and types
- Database schema for dashboard_files
- Authentication middleware
- Sharing library components (for ShareRequest handling)

## Success Criteria

1. All endpoints return appropriate status codes and responses
2. Endpoints handle error cases gracefully
3. All endpoints pass their test cases
4. Endpoints integrate with the existing dashboard functionality

## Implementation Details

Each endpoint will be implemented as a separate REST handler with a corresponding business logic handler. The implementation will follow our established patterns for REST endpoints and handlers.

## Timeline

All phases can be worked on concurrently, with an estimated completion time of 1-2 weeks.

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Database schema changes might be required
  - **Mitigation**: Review schema before implementation and plan any migrations

- **Risk**: Integration with sharing functionality might be complex
  - **Mitigation**: Leverage existing sharing library components
