# Sharing Access Controls Summary PRD

## Overview
This document provides a high-level summary of the sharing access controls implementation, divided into modular, testable tickets. Each component has its own detailed PRD for implementation.

## Components

### 1. User Lookup by Email
**PRD**: [sharing_user_lookup.md](/prds/active/sharing_user_lookup.md)

Implements functionality to look up users by their email addresses, which is essential for email-based sharing features.

**Key Function**:
```rust
pub async fn find_user_by_email(email: &str) -> Result<Option<User>>;
```

### 2. Create/Update Asset Permissions
**PRD**: [sharing_create_permissions.md](/prds/active/sharing_create_permissions.md)

Implements functionality to create or update permissions for a user on an asset, using email address as the identifier.

**Key Function**:
```rust
pub async fn create_share_by_email(
    email: &str,
    asset_id: Uuid,
    asset_type: AssetType,
    role: AssetPermissionRole,
    created_by: Uuid,
) -> Result<AssetPermission>;
```

**Permission Required**: Owner or FullAccess

### 3. Remove Asset Permissions
**PRD**: [sharing_remove_permissions.md](/prds/active/sharing_remove_permissions.md)

Implements functionality to remove a user's permissions for an asset, using email address as the identifier.

**Key Function**:
```rust
pub async fn remove_share_by_email(
    email: &str,
    asset_id: Uuid,
    asset_type: AssetType,
    updated_by: Uuid,
) -> Result<()>;
```

**Permission Required**: Owner or FullAccess

### 4. List Asset Permissions
**PRD**: [sharing_list_permissions.md](/prds/active/sharing_list_permissions.md)

Implements functionality to list all permissions for a given asset.

**Key Function**:
```rust
pub async fn list_shares(
    asset_id: Uuid,
    asset_type: AssetType,
) -> Result<Vec<AssetPermissionWithUser>>;
```

**Permission Required**: All permission levels

### 5. Check Asset Permissions
**PRD**: [sharing_check_permissions.md](/prds/active/sharing_check_permissions.md)

Implements functionality to check if a user has the required permission level for an asset.

**Key Functions**:
```rust
pub async fn check_access(
    asset_id: Uuid,
    asset_type: AssetType,
    identity_id: Uuid,
    identity_type: IdentityType,
) -> Result<Option<AssetPermissionRole>>;

pub async fn has_permission(
    asset_id: Uuid,
    asset_type: AssetType,
    identity_id: Uuid,
    identity_type: IdentityType,
    required_role: AssetPermissionRole,
) -> Result<bool>;
```

**Permission Required**: Internal function, no permission requirements

## Implementation Strategy

These components should be implemented in the following order:

1. User Lookup by Email
2. Check Asset Permissions
3. Create/Update Asset Permissions
4. Remove Asset Permissions
5. List Asset Permissions

This order ensures that dependencies are satisfied before they are needed by other components.

## Testing Strategy

Each component should have:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components
3. **Permission Tests**: Verify permission checks are enforced correctly
4. **Error Handling Tests**: Verify proper error handling for edge cases

## Success Metrics

- All functions pass unit and integration tests
- Performance meets requirements (response times under 100ms)
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- Code is modular and maintainable
