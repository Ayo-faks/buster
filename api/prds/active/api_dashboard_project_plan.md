# Dashboard REST Endpoints Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

The dashboard functionality in our application currently has limited REST API support. While we have endpoints for listing and retrieving dashboards, we lack the ability to create, update, and delete dashboards through the REST API. This limitation prevents users from programmatically managing their dashboards, which is a critical feature for automation and integration with other systems.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a complete set of REST endpoints for dashboard management:

1. **Create Dashboard** (POST /dashboards)
2. **Update Dashboard** (PUT /dashboards/:id)
3. **Delete Dashboard** (DELETE /dashboards/:id)

These endpoints will complement the existing GET endpoints and provide full CRUD functionality for dashboards.

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the dashboard REST endpoints. It details the order in which tasks should be completed, identifies dependencies between tasks, and highlights opportunities for parallel development.

## Endpoints to Implement

1. **Create Dashboard** (POST /dashboards)
2. **Update Dashboard** (PUT /dashboards/:id)
3. **Delete Dashboard** (DELETE /dashboards/:id)

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into phases based on dependencies and complexity. Tasks within each phase can be worked on concurrently.

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Week 1)

**PRDs that can be worked on concurrently:**

- [Create Dashboard Endpoint](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_create_endpoint.md)
  - Implement business logic handler
  - Implement REST handler
  - Update module files

- [Delete Dashboard Endpoint](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_delete_endpoint.md) ✅
  - ✅ Implement business logic handler
  - ✅ Implement REST handler
  - ✅ Update module files

**Rationale:**
- These endpoints have minimal dependencies on each other
- Create and Delete are simpler operations with fewer edge cases
- Both rely on existing database schema and types

**Estimated completion time:** 3-4 days

### Phase 2: Complex Implementation (Week 1-2)

**PRD to implement:**

- [Update Dashboard Endpoint](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_update_endpoint.md)
  - Implement business logic handler
  - Implement REST handler
  - Update module files

**Rationale:**
- Update is more complex due to handling partial updates
- Requires handling file content vs. individual field updates
- Benefits from having Create endpoint completed first to understand the data flow

**Estimated completion time:** 3-5 days

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 2)

**Tasks that can be done concurrently:**

- Unit Tests for all endpoints
  - [Create Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_create_endpoint.md) tests
  - [Update Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_update_endpoint.md) tests
  - [Delete Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_delete_endpoint.md) tests ✅

- Integration Tests for all endpoints
  - [Create Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_create_endpoint.md) tests
  - [Update Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_update_endpoint.md) tests
  - [Delete Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_delete_endpoint.md) tests ✅

**Rationale:**
- Tests can be developed in parallel once the endpoints are implemented
- Integration tests may have dependencies on each other (create before update/delete)

**Estimated completion time:** 3-4 days

### Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization (Week 2)

**Tasks:**
- API Documentation
- Manual Testing
- Code Review
- Final Adjustments

**Estimated completion time:** 1-2 days

## Implementation Details

Each endpoint will be implemented as a separate REST handler with a corresponding business logic handler. The implementation will follow our established patterns for REST endpoints and handlers.

### Technical Stack

- Rust programming language
- Actix-web framework for REST endpoints
- PostgreSQL database for storage
- Existing dashboard models and types
- Sharing library components (for ShareRequest handling)

## Dependencies

### [Create Dashboard Endpoint](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_create_endpoint.md)
- Dependencies: None
- Required for: Update and Delete endpoints (for testing)

### [Update Dashboard Endpoint](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_update_endpoint.md)
- Dependencies: Existing dashboard retrieval logic
- Benefits from: Create Dashboard endpoint

### [Delete Dashboard Endpoint](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_delete_endpoint.md)
- Dependencies: Existing dashboard retrieval logic
- Benefits from: Create Dashboard endpoint (for testing)

## Parallel Development Opportunities

1. **[Create Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_create_endpoint.md) and [Delete Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_delete_endpoint.md) endpoints** can be developed simultaneously by different developers
2. **Unit tests** can be developed alongside the endpoint implementation
3. **Integration tests** can be started once the endpoints are functional

## Resource Allocation

### Single Developer Plan
If one developer is working on all endpoints:
1. Implement [Create Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_create_endpoint.md) endpoint
2. Implement [Delete Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_delete_endpoint.md) endpoint
3. Implement [Update Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_update_endpoint.md) endpoint
4. Develop all tests
5. Complete documentation and finalization

### Multiple Developer Plan
If multiple developers are available:
- Developer 1: [Create Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_create_endpoint.md) endpoint + tests
- Developer 2: [Delete Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_delete_endpoint.md) endpoint + tests
- Developer 3: [Update Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_update_endpoint.md) endpoint + tests
- All: Documentation and finalization

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **Database Schema Compatibility**
   - Risk: Existing schema may not support all required operations
   - Mitigation: Review schema before implementation

2. **File Content Parsing**
   - Risk: YAML parsing errors in Update endpoint
   - Mitigation: Robust error handling and validation

3. **Sharing Integration**
   - Risk: ShareRequest integration complexity
   - Mitigation: Leverage existing sharing components

### Schedule Risks

1. **Testing Complexity**
   - Risk: Integration tests may be more complex than anticipated
   - Mitigation: Start testing early, use mock data

2. **Dependency Delays**
   - Risk: Delays in one endpoint affecting others
   - Mitigation: Prioritize [Create Dashboard](mdc:prds/active/api_dashboard_create_endpoint.md) endpoint, use mock responses for testing

## Success Criteria

1. All endpoints pass unit and integration tests
2. Endpoints handle error cases gracefully
3. Documentation is complete and accurate
4. Code review feedback is addressed
5. Manual testing confirms functionality

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to completing the dashboard REST endpoints. By working on Create and Delete endpoints concurrently, followed by the more complex Update endpoint, we can efficiently complete the implementation while managing dependencies.

The testing phase can leverage parallel development to ensure comprehensive test coverage. With proper resource allocation and risk management, we can complete the implementation within the estimated 1-2 week timeframe.
