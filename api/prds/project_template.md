### Component Breakdown

<!-- 
Break down the project into logical components. For each component:
- Describe its purpose
- Reference the sub-PRD that will implement it
- Define interfaces with other components

## Implementation Plan

<!-- 
Break down the implementation into sub-PRDs and clearly define:
1. The order in which sub-PRDs should be implemented
2. Which sub-PRDs can be developed concurrently
3. Dependencies between sub-PRDs
4. How to avoid conflicts between concurrent development efforts

Track the status of each sub-PRD:
- Complete
- In Progress
- Upcoming
-->

### Sub-PRD Implementation Order and Dependencies

The implementation will be broken down into the following sub-PRDs, with their dependencies and development order clearly defined:

1. [Foundation Component](link_to_foundation_prd.md) - **Must be completed first**
   - This PRD establishes the core functionality needed by all other components
   - Dependencies: None
   - Required for: All other PRDs

2. [Component A](link_to_component_a_prd.md) - **Can be developed concurrently with Components B and C**
   - Dependencies: Foundation Component
   - Required for: Component D
   - Potential conflict areas with Component B: [Describe and provide mitigation]

3. [Component B](link_to_component_b_prd.md) - **Can be developed concurrently with Components A and C**
   - Dependencies: Foundation Component
   - Required for: Component E
   - Potential conflict areas with Component A: [Describe and provide mitigation]

4. [Component C](link_to_component_c_prd.md) - **Can be developed concurrently with Components A and B**
   - Dependencies: Foundation Component
   - Required for: None
   - No conflicts with other concurrent components

5. [Component D](link_to_component_d_prd.md) - **Must wait for Component A**
   - Dependencies: Foundation Component, Component A
   - Required for: None

6. [Component E](link_to_component_e_prd.md) - **Must wait for Component B**
   - Dependencies: Foundation Component, Component B
   - Required for: None

### Concurrent Development Strategy

To enable efficient concurrent development without conflicts:

1. **Clear Component Interfaces**: Each sub-PRD must define clear interfaces for how other components interact with it
2. **Separate Database Concerns**: Ensure database schema changes are coordinated to prevent conflicts
3. **Modular Code Structure**: Organize code to minimize overlap between components
4. **Regular Integration**: Plan for regular integration points to catch conflicts early
5. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to allow merging incomplete features without affecting production

### Phase 1: Foundation

<!-- Describe the first phase of implementation -->

**Components:**
- Foundation Component

**Success Criteria:**
- Core interfaces defined and implemented
- Database schema changes completed
- Unit tests passing at 90%+ coverage
- Integration tests defined

### Phase 2: Parallel Component Development

<!-- Describe the second phase of implementation -->

**Components:**
- Component A
- Component B
- Component C

**Success Criteria:**
- All components implemented according to their respective PRDs
- Components successfully integrated with Foundation Component
- No regressions in Foundation Component functionality
- Unit and integration tests passing

### Phase 3: Dependent Components

<!-- Describe the third phase of implementation -->

**Components:**
- Component D
- Component E

**Success Criteria:**
- All components implemented according to their respective PRDs
- Full system integration completed
- End-to-end tests passing
- Performance benchmarks met
