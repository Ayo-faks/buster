# PRD Template
<!-- 
This template is designed to help you create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).
Key points to remember:
- Be specific and detailed in each section
- Include technical details where relevant
- Consider all stakeholders
- Think about edge cases and potential issues
- Document assumptions and dependencies
-->

## Problem Statement ‚úÖ
<!-- 
Clearly articulate the problem you're solving. Include:
- Current state
- Pain points
- Impact on users/system
- Why it needs to be solved now
- Any relevant metrics or data
-->

The current Buster CLI's `deploy` command and the API's deployment endpoint have diverged in their handling of dataset creation and validation. The CLI supports advanced features like:
1. Global configuration via buster.yml
2. Model-level overrides
3. Searchable dimensions (stored values)
4. Cross-project entity relationships

This misalignment can cause deployment inconsistencies and confusion for users.

Key issues:
- Configuration handling differs between CLI and API
- Stored values flag naming inconsistency (searchable vs stored_values)
- Entity relationships handled differently
- Success/failure reporting differences
- Validation scope misalignment
