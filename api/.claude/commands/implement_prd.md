ok I need you to implement the prds/active/$ARGUMENTS.md prd following it in 
order and accomplishing the tasks while referencing the prd, its notes, and recommendations.

make sure to mark off completed tasks as you go.

you should follow best practices as related in documentation/ for database migrations, testing.mdc, handlers.mdc, 
etc. Plase analyze them before you modify a file.

please analyze all files before proceeding with any implementations.

you should think hard about your implementation and then implement carefully.

you are not done until tests for your specific file are finsished and a cargo check runs successfully.
