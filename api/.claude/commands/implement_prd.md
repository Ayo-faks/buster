ok I need you to implement the $ARGUMENTS prd following it in 
order and accomplishing the tasks while referencing the prd, its notes, and recommendations.

you should follow best practices as related in documentation/ for database migrations, testing, handlers, 
etc.

please analyze all files before proceeding with any implementations.

you are not done until tests for your specific file are finsished and a cargo check runs successfully.
